title: Deleting your Discord account, the right way
---

Discord is a terrible service when it comes to privacy, and even if you delete your account, your messages (and other data) is not deleted (and kept forever because you can't delete it anymore if you have already deleted your account). In this post, I want to talk about how to delete as much data as possible on Discord before you'll click that "Delete Account" button.

### 1. Delete your messages

Like I said before, your messages aren't deleted at all. They are "anonymized", which doesn't even make sense as you have most likely shared private information in here (the anonymization works by changing your username to "Deleted User"). There's a nice tool on GitHub that allows you to delete **all** of your Discord messages - [discord-delete](https://github.com/adversarialtools/discord-delete).

It's simple to use. [Get your Discord token](https://discordhelp.net/discord-token), copy it, download the app and run it:

```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x ./discord-delete-linux
# Run it!
DISCORD_TOKEN="ENTER-YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN-HERE" ./discord-delete-linux partial
```

Replace `ENTER-YOUR-DISCORD-TOKEN-HERE` with your Discord token. This process will take a while if you've talked on Discord a lot. I recommend you to run it multiple times to ensure that it did delete everything (it used to miss some messages for me).

`INFO[0222] Finished deleting messages: XXX deleted in XXX total requests` means that it has finished deleting your messages.

### 2. Remove everyone from your friends list

I don't think have to explain this. Go to **Friends -> All** and remove everyone you see here.

### 3. Delete/transfer ownership of your servers

This is something that's required by Discord itself to delete your account.

### 4. Leave all servers

Self-explanatory too.

### 5. Remove as much other information as possible (before you'll delete your account)

This makes sure that you'll leave Discord with your data fully anonymized already (which Discord doesn't do properly).

1. Change your username (and profile picture) to something random

2. Change your e-mail address

**Warning: It looks like Discord does detect emails generated by Gmailnator so it may ask you for your phone number if you'll change your email.** 

Discord started banning "10 minute mail" addresses, but you can easily use [Gmailnator](https://gmailnator.com) which provides disposable `@gmail.com` addresses. The UI looks confusing, but it's actually easy to use it - uncheck the `gmailnator` option and click Go.

3. Delete any other remaining personal information

If you've used 2FA, there's a very high chance that you have your phone number as a backup 2FA method. Remove it.

### 6. Delete your account

You've deleted almost everything that could be used to identify you; it's time to click the "Delete Account" button.

Go to **User Settings -> My Account -> Edit** and click on **Delete Account**.

You'll see this:

![Discord asking the user to provide their password before deleting their account](https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/115002140711/Delete_Account_2.PNG)

Type in your password, and delete it.

## Congrats! It's gone.
