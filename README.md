# My blog

- Built with Jekyll
- Mostly JS-free; JavaScript is only used for comments
- Automatically minifies HTML and (S)CSS
- No tracking, uses [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) (GitHub issues) for comments
- Very lightweight; the main page uses ~5KB of data and post pages ~50KB (images excluded)
